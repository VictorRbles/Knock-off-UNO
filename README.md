# Knock-off-UNO

Howdy, 

This is a cheaply made knock off of the UNO card game. The game does not include an interface and has to be played bia the built-in terminal of whatever compiler you are using to run this. The game features the abiity to play with up to 13 people including yourself of course, two completely new cards (at least I think, I am not a UNO expert) AND cards and OR cards, which are basically get four cards, but with an extra twist. There is still a lot of features I would like to add to it such as:
  * An AI that can play the game with you also known as an NPC, since if you are like me no one wants to play this game with you specially since it all has to be done from       the console and on a singular device and could instead play the real deal with you.
  * Memory allocation for a variety of variables and arrays.
  * A dynamic list of cards

And I think that is it at least for now. I could also try to make difficulties for the AI. Maybe then it will be worth of calling rip-off.

You may be wordering why is it a cheap knock off, well the answer to that is easy. It is because I did not spend a single cent to make it, but most important of it all it does not have an interface. Making it cheap in replayability, I honestly was going to say I did not spend much time on this kind of like I did on the Alien Invasion, but that would have been lying. I am still lazy, do include that.

Bye, now.

Mattel do not sue me, please.
