Howdy,

The Instructions on how to play are as follows:
1.- Your name has a limit of 127 characters, if you trying going past it, it would register after the 127th character

2.- I would recommend making the console as big as possible since the hands of the players get displayed in order
meaning player one hand's gets display before all of them, then comes the second player and so on.

3.- Minimum amount of player is 2 and maximum is 14.

4.- Much like an uno game the card to start the game comes from the deck and not from the players. In this case, it
is the first card of the deck.

5.- You will always be given the range of the numbers of cards you can use, does not mean you can use any of them,
you have to look at which one you can actually use in the ocassion.

6.- When using special cards OR or AND you will be prompted with a questions about which card do you want to pair it
with, if you enter a number that is not listed as a possibility, the turn will "restart" which just means it would
still be your turn, but you will no longer be playing the special card you were. You can always just pick the special
card again. I added this since those two card are the only that require more than one step to use and you may want
to backup.

7.- You can always at anytime grab a card from the deck altough this wastes your turn. 

8.- If there are 2 or more players with the same cards first player to be found with the fewest amount of cards wins.

9.- Please make sure to read everything carefully since the program most of the time does not tell you the input
was incorrect, but rather just repeat the prompt for you to input it again.
